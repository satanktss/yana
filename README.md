# Valentines Site
A site made for my girlfriend for Valentines Day.

## Project Notes 
Besides making a nice little gift for my girlfriend, I wanted to pursue this project to learn more about web development and, more specifically, the interesting interactivity and animations possible with vanilla CSS and JavaScript.  
  
I also wanted to use the CSS framework Tailwind a little bit, simply because I was curious to see how it worked and it and similar frameworks are used in production for businesses.
